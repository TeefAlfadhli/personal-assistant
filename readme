# Personal Assistant

A Python-based personal assistant that uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to provide intelligent tools and resources through a client-server architecture.

## Overview

This project implements a personal assistant system with an AI agent that can interact with various tools and resources through an MCP server. The architecture is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible.

## Project Structure

```
personal-assistant/
├── mcp_server.py      # MCP server implementation with tools/resources/prompts
├── functionality.py   # Core logic and functions for tools (keeps server clean)
├── connection.py      # Client-server connection handling
└── agent.py          # AI agent behavior and client interaction logic
```

## Components

### `mcp_server.py`
Runs your MCP server and defines tools/resources/prompts. This is the main server component that handles requests and manages available tools.

### `functionality.py`
Contains the actual logic/functions your tools use. This module keeps the server code clean by separating business logic from server implementation.

### `connection.py`
Handles client-server connection logic. Manages the communication layer between the client and server components.

### `agent.py`
Implements your AI agent's behavior, using the client to interact with the server. This is where the intelligent decision-making and tool orchestration happens.
